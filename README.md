# Typing speed analysis

Analysis of my own touch typing speed for speed improvement purposes. This
project consider my results obtained in [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

The code is not an ordinary script, but a is in a Jupyter Notebook notation to
be executed in VS Code or similar editors that have the capacity of executing
Python scripts as a notebook through the tags `# %%`.

To use this analysis for your own purposes, create the file `config/api.json`
and add you APE key from [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) in an object
with a string attribute `apiKey` as follows:
```javascript
{
    "apiKey": "YOUR_APE_KEY_GOES_HERE"
}
```

**Note:** For now, the project is just an analysis, so the code and processes are not
optimized yet.
